This jupyter notebook is essentially a crash course in Bayesian statistics where I try to cover the most important probabilistic ideas and numerical methods for the Master/PhD course Geophysical Data Science GEO4300/GEO9300 at the University of Oslo. It is a guest lecture that I give in a course led by Norbert Pirk covering a wide range of data science topics with relevance to research in geophysics of the entire Earth system (not just fossils) and beyond.

Please reach out to Kristoffer Aalstad (kristoffer.aalstad@geo.uio.no) if you spot any typos, errors, or have any feedback.
